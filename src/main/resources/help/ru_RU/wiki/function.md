## What is a function

Functions allow players to run lists of commands using text files with the extension .mcfunction.

## Settings and Configuration

### Naming

You can write your function name in one word or with several words with underscore(s).

**Examples:**

* advancement
* advancement\_biome\_reward

### Namespace

**Mod:** Is used for your mod only. (Display like your\_mod\_id:function\_name)

**Minecraft:** Is used with some Minecraft options (Display like minecraft:function\_name)

### Commands

Write all commands you want in the code section. You don't have to write the "/" before commands. You can only write one command per line. If you write more than one, it will not work, and you will have an error. You can only use Vanilla commands, otherwise, with custom commands, your function won't work.
