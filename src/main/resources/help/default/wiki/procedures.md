# Procedures

Procedures allow adding logic to your mod without writing Java code.

MCreator uses a visual programming system (similar to Scratch). You connect logic blocks to define behavior.

Usage examples:
* Give a potion effect when eating an item.
* Explosion when breaking a block.
* Spawn a mob when a key is pressed.
