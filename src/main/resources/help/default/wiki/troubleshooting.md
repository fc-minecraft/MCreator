# Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors (Gradle error):

1. Check the console, the reason is often written there.
2. Try clearing the Gradle cache (in settings).
3. Make sure you have an internet connection if this is the first run.
4. Check if you are using invalid characters in element IDs.
